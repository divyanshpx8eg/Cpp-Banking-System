# Cpp Banking System
The Bank Management System is a console-based application written in C++ that simulates basic banking operations. It provides functionality for customers to manage their accounts (view balance, deposit, withdraw) and for admins to manage customers (view all, delete accounts). The system stores user and account information in text files for persistence between sessions.
